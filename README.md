# scrn2com.exe 

sends the current video character memory to output.txt & com1 when it runs

would be more useful as a TSR , i havent figured out how to do that in pacific


# Compiling

Uses [pacific](https://archive.org/details/pacific_c-751-msdos) C compiler.

pacific needs a 286 for the ide, but it does create 8088 & 8086 small-memory targets

360k-disk.img in the repo for a 360k disk image with the demo program on it

# next tasks
-impliment tsr

in openwatcom i believe [this](http://www.openwatcom.org/ftp/manuals/current/clib.pdf) would be the route to go for implimenting TSR but i have none of this to work with in pacific
